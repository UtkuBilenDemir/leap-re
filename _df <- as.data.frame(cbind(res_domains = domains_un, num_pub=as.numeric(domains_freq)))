     ...: One of the following

            • any number of plotly/ggplot2 objects.

            • a list of plotly/ggplot2 objects.

            • a tibble with one list-column of plotly/ggplot2 objects.

   nrows: number of rows for laying out plots in a grid-like structure.
          Only used if no domain is already specified.

  widths: relative width of each column on a 0-1 scale. By default all
          columns have an equal relative width.

 heights: relative height of each row on a 0-1 scale. By default all
          rows have an equal relative height.

  margin: either a single value or four values (all between 0 and 1).
          If four values are provided, the first is used as the left
          margin, the second is used as the right margin, the third is
          used as the top margin, and the fourth is used as the bottom
          margin. If a single value is provided, it will be used as all
          four margins.

  shareX: should the x-axis be shared amongst the subplots?

  shareY: should the y-axis be shared amongst the subplots?

  titleX: should x-axis titles be retained?

  titleY: should y-axis titles be retained?

which_layout: adopt the layout of which plot? If the default value of
          "merge" is used, layout options found later in the sequence
          of plots will override options found earlier in the sequence.
          This argument also accepts a numeric vector specifying which
          plots to consider when merging.
