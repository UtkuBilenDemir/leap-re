A co-publication is a publication that have been produced with collaboration of at least two organisations. Therefore, a co-publication contains at least two affiliations. 3.1 Overall Figures This sub-chapter mainly deals with number of RE-related publication outputs in African countries in the 10 years period between 2011-2020. Figure 3.1: Number of RE-related publications in African countries over the years between 2011-2020 African countries have collaborated in approximately 31k renewable energy (RE) publications in the 10 year range between 2011-2020. The number of those RE-related publications has been constantly increasing between until 2019. Slightly declining publication numbers between 2019 and 2020 (see 3.1), as Web of Science (WoS) team also often emphasises, is caused by the latency in the database entries.1 Even after including the possibly incomplete amount of publications in 2020, number of RE-related publications from the African countries in total increases from ~1.1k in 2011 to ~4.8k in 2020 which is an increment by factor ~4.2. Figure 3.2: Total number of RE-related publications in African countries between 2011-2020 As 3.2 shows, South Africa and Egypt are the most visible countries with 6.8k and 6.6k publications respectively. 20 African countries stay under 40 RE-related publications in total between 2011-2020. The most visible countries distributed diversely on the continent, however, other than the Northern African countries and South Africa only Nigeria contributed in over 1000 RE-related publications (2252 pub.). Although total publication output is a strong indicator of the most visible countries, it does not show the growth rate in the numbers. African countries that show high increment rate in the number of publications despite having relatively lower total amount of publications will be analysed in the following chapter. Figure 3.3: Most visible 15 African countries in RE-related publications between 2011-2020 4 of the most visible 5 organisations in RE-related publications are from South Africa. Each of them has close to or over 800 publications between 2011-2020, Cairo University from Egypt is following them with ~780 publications. Although, most of the visible organisaitons are in general universities, there is also Renewable Energy Development Center from Algeria, an institution specifically focuses on RE-related topics with an output of ~800 publications between 2011-2020. Figure 3.4: Distribution of research domains in RE-related publications of African countries between 2011-2020 2 Over 50% of the RE-related publications are associated with research areas from Technology domain. Energy &amp; Fuels is the most visible research area in total followed by Electrical &amp; Elctronic Engineering. Other Engineering fields like Chemical, Environmental, Mechanical Engineering also in the visible research areas. Multidisciplinary discipline Green &amp; Sustainable Science &amp; Technology is the 3. most visible research area in total. Life Science $ Biomedicine and Physical Sciences have similar number of publications (~8800 pub. both). Environmental Science and Ecology from Life Sciences &amp; Biomedicine as well as Multidisciplinary Materials Science and Thermodynamics from Physical Sciences are also in the 10 most visible research areas. Social Sciences (1325 pub.) is also not absent in the RE-related publications of African organisations. Environmental Studies is the most visible research area in this domain with 663 publications. 3.2 Regional Analysis Following the overall figures of the RE-related publications in Africa this sub-chapter introduces geographical regions of Africa to bring the analysis one step further. Focusing on different regions of Africa prevents the over-representation of already more visible countries in terms of publications in general and also enables a detailed analysis for individual countries and organisations. Figure 3.5: African Union Regions Although the most common definition of African geographical regions is the categorization of the United Nations Statistics Department (UNSD), as the Figure 3.5 shows, this report uses a different categorization, namely African Union Geographical Regions. The reason for this decision solely lies on the more evenly sized regions in AU categorization. As Figure ?? summarizes, 4 of the most visible African countries in the RE-related publications are from Northern Africa. South Africa has the highest number of publications. Nigeria and Ghana from Western Africa, Ethiopia and Kenya from Eastern Africa are following those 5 countries. Cameroon is the only country from Central Africa that finds a place between the 15 most visible countries. 3.2.1 Northern Africa Figure 3.6: RE-related publication output in Northern African countries Countries of Northern Africa have collaborated approximately in the half of the total number of renewable energy related publications (17116 publications out of 31099). 4 of the 5 most visible African countries in RE-related publications are from the northern region; namely Egypt, Algeria, Tunisia and Morocco. As table 3.6 presents all of the Northern Africa countries increased their number of RE-related publications. Although, as discussed in the previous chapter, slight declines in the number of publications between 2019-2020 are most likely caused by the delay of document entry into the Web of Science databases, Algeria and Tunisia show a decline in their number of publications starting 2017 and 2018 respectively. In the cases of Libya and Mauritania, however, volatility in the number of publications is expected as their total publication outputs are relatively lower. Another important observation is in the relative growth rates,3 Morocco’s number of RE-related publications in 2020 is approximately 16 times higher the number in 2011. This growth rate is not only the highest in Northern Africa but in the whole continent. Figure 3.7: Co-publication network of Northern African countries in RE-related publications between 2011-2020 RE-related co-publications of the Northern African countries shows a rich international network but the co-publication network with other African regions stays relatively less dense. Only African countries from other regions which have co-published over 25 RE-related papers with Northern African countries are South Africa (28 pub.) and Nigeria (26 pub.). Egypt, the most visible country in Northern Africa, with ~6.6k publications in total plays a central role in the network, relatively uniform distributed co-publication network of Egypt includes over 10 EU-27 countries as well as a number of countries from other regions of the world like USA, China, India, United Kingdom. Egypt’s strongest link in the co-publications however is with organisations from Saudi Arabia. Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco have relatively high numbers of collaborations with French organisations with 751, 881 and 601 co-publications respectively. France in general is the most visible EU-27 country in the RE-related co-publications with African countries. The 4 mentioned Northern African countries so far, Egypt, Algeria, Tunisia and Morocco are co-publication wise relatively well interconnected, however, Libya stays out of the co-publication cluster in Northern Africa, from Libya’s 233 RE-related publications in the last 10 years none of the Northern African countries had over 25 co-publications with Libya, instead Libya’s most visible collaborators are United Kingdom (38 co-pub.) and Malaysia (29 co-pub.). Following the given analysis of RE-related publication outputs in the Northern Africa; Egypt, Algeria and Morocco have been chosen for the deeper analysis of the individual countries. While Egypt and Algeria hold the highest numbers of RE-related publications in the northern region, Morocco has been mainly chosen for the high growth rate in the number of publications. 3.2.1.1 Egypt The most visible Egyptian organisation in the RE-related publications is Cairo university with a total 779 publications between 2011-2020. All of the most visible 5 organisations show relatively linear growth in number of RE-related publications. However, Ain Shams University and Tanta University show a stagnation between 2019-2020 which might be caused by the delay of document entries into the Web of Science system as mentioned earlier. Furthermore, Tanta University, which had yearly fewer than 50 RE-related publications until 2016, published in 2019 and 2020 ~125 RE-related papers, this a growth rate of ~14 with respect to the 9 publications in 2011. Figure 3.8: Co-publication network in RE-related publications in organisaitons from Egypt between 2011-2020 Co-publication network of Egyptian organisations display a relatively dense collaboration structure between Cairo University, Ain Shams University and National Research Centre of Egpyt with over 50 publications together. Individual collaborations of those organisations include collaborations with 7 other Egyptian academic organisations with over 20 RE-related co-publications. Another visible collaborations are between Minia and Aswan Universities with over 50 publications and between Tanta and Kafrelsheikh Universities with over 70 publications together. In general collaborations with organisations from Saudi Arabia are highly visible in the network, other than Tanta University’s collaborations with Chinese Institutions and Aswan University’s with Japanese orgnisations also present links with more than 20 publications together. Visible organisations from EU-27 countries are Université Bourgogne Franche-Comté from France, Ruhr university Bochum from Germany, Budapest University of Technology and Economics from Hungary and University of Jaen from Spain. 3.2.1.1.1 Cairo University Figure 3.9: Absolute and relative growth in RE-related publications from Cairo University between 2011-2020 Out of 779 publication of Cairo University, most visible research areas are aligning with the most visible research areas in RE-related publications from African countries in general. Energy &amp; Fuels as well as Electrical &amp; Electronic Engineering are the most visible research areas in Cairo university, hover the number of RE-related in those areas are not growing in the last years. After the spike in 2017 with ~50 publications, number of publications from Energy &amp; Fuels has fallen to ~30 publications in the last 2019 and 2020. Green &amp; Sustainable Science &amp; Technology and Environmental Sciences on the other hand show a relatively steady growth in numbers. Considering there was only 1 from each area in 2011, ~20 RE-related publications in 2020 makes those the fastest growing research areas in the RE-related publications from Cairo University. 3.2.1.2 Algeria Renewable Energy Development Center, Algeria’s dedicated institution for RE-related research is the most visible Organisation in the country with ~690 publications. However, number of RE-related publications of the institution is falling down after a spike in 2018 with 127 publications. Although the latency in the record entry process in WoS databases might be causing a proportion of the decline, number of publications in 2020 seems to be less than half of the number in 2018 (54 pub.). Houari Boumediene University of Sciences is another Algerian institution that publishes RE-related papers consistently. A similar decline in the number of publications like in case of Renewable Energy Development Center can be observed after 2018 from 75 publications to 44 publications in 2020. École Nationale Polytechnique d’Oran University, Ferhat Abbas of Setif and University of Batna are other organisations with similar numbers of RE-related publications (259, 241, 239 pub. respectively), each of those have increased their yearly RE-related publication output to ~30 yearly. Figure 3.10: Co-publication network in RE-related publications in organisaitons from Algeria between 2011-2020 Co-publication network of Algerian organisations mostly gathered around Renewable Energy Development Center, the institution often collaborates with other Algerian academic institutions. Most visible collaborations are with Houari Boumediene University of Sciences and École Nationale Polytechnique d’Oran University, both with an output over 60 co-publications. Most of the international collaborators with more than 25 co-publications with Algerian institutions are French, the collaboration between University of Batna and University of Picardy Jules Verne is the most visible one with 27 co-publications between 2011-2020. University of Jijel collaborates also often with Italian institutions like University of Trieste (23 co-pub.) and International Centre for Theoretical Physics (28 co-pub.). 3.2.1.2.1 Renewable Energy Development Center Figure 3.11: TEST The most visible research area in the RE-related publications of Renewable Energy Development Center is Energy &amp; Fuels, although related number of publications has fallen to 34 in 2020 from 86 in 2018. Green &amp; Sustaibable Science in Technology is the second most visible area. Most of the visible areas in institutions RE-related publications show a decline in numbers after 2018. 3.2.1.3 Morocco Morocco has the most rapidly growing number of publications in the 15 most visible African countries in RE-related publications with having 543 publications in 2020 in comparison with 34 RE-related publications in 2011. The same pattern is also observable in the publications of Moroccan Institutions. Each one of the RE-wise most visible 5 organisations in Morocco had 1 digit RE-related publications in 2011 and each of those have published at least ~8 folds of those numbers in 2020. Mohamed V University is the most visible Moroccan institution in the RE-related publications with 667 publications in total. There is a slight decline in the number of publications after 2018 but the university still collaborates in over 100 RE-related publications yearly. Mohamed V and Mohamed I Universities are both publishing in comparison with 2011 ~25 times more in RE-related topics. University of Sfax, University of Casablanca and Cadi Ayyad University are most visible 2., 3. and 4. organisations respectively Figure 3.12: Co-publication network in RE-related publications in organisaitons from Morocco between 2011-2020 Moroccan organisations are interconnected in the RE-related publications with only a few collaborations with an output of more than 25 co-publications. Although Mohamed V Uni. has a central position the native collaboration is relatively uniform distributed. International collaborations includes mostly French institutions like Uni. of Lorraine, Uni. of Montpellier and University of Pau and Pays de l’Adour. 3.2.1.3.1 Mohammed V University Figure 3.13: TEST 3.2.2 Western Africa, Central Africa, Eastern Africa 3.2.2.1 Western Africa Figure 3.14: RE-related publication output in Western African countries Western African countries Nigeria and Ghana have been increasing their RE-related publication output in a consistent manner in the 10 years range (see table 3.14) without any stagnation. Although Nigeria’s number of publications in 2011 already relatively high in comparison (74 pub.), number of publications in 2020 was ~6.5 folds (481 pub.) of that. In a similar fashion Ghana has increased its RE-related publication output from 20 in 2011 to 153 in 2020 which is an increment of a factor of ~7.5. Volatility in the publication nummbers of Burkina Faso and Benin is expected since their publication outputs relatively lower. Senegal’s output of RE-related publication, however, has fallen to 28 in 2020 after 49 publications in 2018. Figure 3.15: Co-publication network of Western African countries in RE-related publications between 2011-2020 Nigeria is also the centre of mass in the co-publication network of the Western African countries. It is the only Western African country with more than 25 co-publications with a Northern African country (Egypt, 26 co-pub). In a similar manner, together with Ghana Nigeria is the only Western African Country with more than 25 co-pub. with South Africa (277 pub.), namely the most visible country in Africa. Nigeria also collaborates with Ghana, the second most visible country from Western Africa. Collaborations of those 2 countries are mostly produced with international partners United Kingdom, China and United States. However, the collaborations between the two most visible countries in the region with the other countries are relatively sparse. Côte d’Ivoire, Benin, Senegal, Burkina Faso and Mali are mostly engaged in their own cluster. The most visible international partner of that cluster is France. French academic organisations have co-publicated ~400 papers with Western African countries between 2011-2020 and most of those have been carried out with the mentioned 5 countries. Other than France, Germany and Netherlands are also engaged in the RE-related publications in Western Africa; Sweden and Denmark are mostly collaborated with Ghana and Italian organisations have mostly co-published with Nigerian organisations. Other visible international partners in the region are Malaysia and India. Figure 3.16: Most visible organisations from Nigeria, Ghana, Senegal cluster Most visible 3 organisations in Western Africa are from Nigeria. Number of the RE-related publications from Covenant University, the most visible organisation in the region, seems to be declining presumably because of the latency in document entries into WoS databases after 2019. Other than Covenant University total RE-related publication outputs of other most visible organisations in Western Africa are relatively close to each other. Other than University of Ibadan other 3 organisations also consistently increasing numbers of their Re-related publications. 3.2.2.2 Central Africa Figure 3.17: RE-related publication output in Central African countries In the Central African region the publication output in the RE-related topics is relatively volatile. Cameroon shows a steady increment between 2011-2020 (see 3.17) with a total output of 379 RE-related publications in 10 years. Other than Cameroon total number of RE-related publications in other Central African countries stays under 100. Figure 3.18: Co-publication network of Central African countries in RE-related publications between 2011-2020 France is again the most visible EU-27 country in the co-publication network in Central Africa with 121 co-pub. with the most visible Central African country Cameroon. Although the publication output is not high in comparison with other regions, most of the publications in Central Africa produced through international co-operation and all of the visible international collaborator countries are engaged in co-publications with Cameroon, most visible country in the region. Figure 3.19: Most visible organisations from Cameroon, Dem. Rep. Congo, Gabon cluster All of the most visible 5 countries in region are from Cameroon with most visible organisation being Université de Yaoundé I with 170 RE-related publications in 2020. None of the organisations in the region has more than 5 RE-related publications in 2011 3.2.2.3 Eastern Africa Figure 3.20: RE-related publication output in Eastern African countries The most visible 5 Eastern African countries have steadily increasing number of RE-related publications (see 3.20). Ethiopia and Kenya are the most visible ones with 940 and 870 publications respectively. Ethiopia’s number of publications in 2020 (226 pub.) is approximetaly 8 fold of the number in 2011 (28). Figure 3.21: Co-publication network of Eastern African countries in RE-related publications between 2011-2020 4 most visible countries in Eastern Africa; Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda are fairly interconnected in terms of RE-related co-publications with each other as well as with international collaborators. A number of EU-27 countries like France, Italy, Germany, Belgium, Sweden, Netherlands, Austria, Spain and Denmark are engaged in co-publications with Eastern African countries. Both Ethiopia and Kenya show significant number of co-publications with Germany (72 and 134 pub. respectively). France is also the only collaborator of Madagascar with a number of pub. higher than 25 between 2011-2020. Other than EU countries United States and United Kingdom are also visible international partners engaged in RE-related research with Eastern African organisations. United States has ~500 co-publications with the region. South Africa is the only African country from another region that has more than 25 RE-related co-publications with the Eastern African countries. South Africa’s total RE-related co-publication output with the Eastern African countries between 2011-2020 is 199. Figure 3.22: Most visible organisations from Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania cluster Most visible countries from the selected countries in Eastern Africa, namely Ethiopia, Kenya Tanzania are diverse. Addis Ababa University from Ethiopia is the most visible one with 246 RE-related publications between 2011-2020. Number of publications from Addis Ababa University has been increasing steadily. 3.2.2.4 Selected Institutions and Institutional Co-publication Network Figure 3.23: Co-publication network of Western, Central, Eastern African organisations in RE-related publications between 2011-2020 3.2.2.4.1 Covenant University (Nigeria) Figure 3.24: TEST The most visible research areas are Energy &amp; Fuels and Green &amp; Sustainable Science &amp; Technology similarly. However, Covenant University also Multidisciplinary Sciences as one of the most visible research areas. None of the last three research areas Multidisciplinary Sciences, Material Science and Electrical &amp; Electronic Engineering had more than 1 yearly RE-related publications in Covenant University until 2016. However, especially Multidisciplinary Sciences had over 10 yearly publications starting after 2017. 3.2.2.4.2 University of Nigeria Figure 3.25: TEST 3.2.2.4.3 Université de Yaoundé I (Cameroon) Figure 3.26: TEST 3.2.2.4.4 Addis Ababa University (Ethiopia) Figure 3.27: TEST 3.2.2.4.5 Mekelle University (Ethiopia) Figure 3.28: TEST 3.2.3 Southern Africa Figure 3.29: RE-related publication output in Southern African countries Figure 3.30: Co-publication network of Southern African countries in RE-related publications between 2011-2020 Figure 3.31: Most visible organisations from South Africa Figure 3.32: Co-publication network of Southern African organisations in RE-related publications between 2011-2020 3.2.3.0.1 University of KwaZulu-Natal Figure 3.33: TEST 3.2.3.0.2 University of Cape Town Figure 3.34: TEST 3.2.3.0.3 Stellenbosch University Figure 3.35: TEST As Web of Science support service informs, it might take up to 2 years for a document to be entered into the Web of Science databases.↩︎ Caution, research domains and areas are not unique to a publication.
