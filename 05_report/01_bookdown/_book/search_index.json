A co-publication is a publication that have been produced with collaboration of at least two organisations. Therefore, a co-publication contains at least two affiliations. 3.1 Overall Figures This sub-chapter mainly deals with number of RE-related publication outputs in African countries in the 10 years period between 2011-2020. Figure 3.1: Number of RE-related publications in African countries over the years between 2011-2020 African countries have collaborated in approximately 31k renewable energy (RE) publications in the 10 year range between 2011-2020. The number of those RE-related publications has been constantly increasing between until 2019. Slightly declining publication numbers between 2019 and 2020 (see 3.1), as Web of Science team also often emphasises, is caused by the latency in the database entries.1 Even after including the possibly incomplete amount of publications in 2020, number of RE-related publications from the African countries in total increases from ~1.1k in 2011 to ~4.8k in 2020 which is an increment by factor ~4.2. Figure 3.2: Total number of RE-related publications in African countries between 2011-2020 As 3.2 shows, South Africa and Egypt are the most visible countries with 6.8k and 6.6k publications respectively. 20 countries stay under 40 RE-related publications in total between 2011-2020, the most visible countries distributed diversely on the continent. Although total publication output is a strong indicator of the most visible countries, it does not show the growth rate in the number of Publications. African countries that show high increment rate in the number of publications despite having relatively lower total amount of publications will be analysed in the following chapter. Figure 3.3: Most visible 15 African countries in RE-related publications between 2011-2020 Figure 3.4: Most visible 15 research areas in RE-related publications between 2011-2020 Figure 3.5: Distribution of research domains in RE-related publications of African countries between 2011-2020 2 Figure 3.6: Most visible research areas 3.2 Regional Analysis Following the overall figures of the RE-related publications in Africa this sub-chapter introduces geographical regions of Africa to bring the analysis one step further. Focusing on different regions of Africa prevents the over representation of already more visible countries in terms of publications in general and also enables a Figure 3.7: test Although the most common definition of African geographical regions is the categorization of the United Nations Statistics Department (UNSD), as the Figure 3.7 shows, this research uses a different categorization, namely African Union Geographical Regions. The reason for this decision solely lies on the more evenly sized regions in AU categorization. 3.2.1 Northern Africa Figure 3.8: RE-related publication output in Northern African countries Countries of Northern Africa have collaborated approximately in the half of the total number of renewable energy related publications (17116 publications out of 31099). 4 of the 5 most visible African countries in RE-related publications are from the northern region; namely Egypt, Algeria, Tunisia and Morocco. As table 3.8 presents all of the Northern Africa countries increased their number of RE-related publications. Although, as discussed in the previous chapter, slight declines in the number of publications between 2019-2020 are most likely caused by the delay of document entry into the Web of Science databases, Algeria and Tunisia show a decline in their number of publications starting 2017 and 2018 respectively. In the cases of Libya and Mauritania, however, volatility in the number of publications is expected as their total publication outputs are relatively lower. Another important observation is in the relative growth rates,3 Morocco’s number of RE-related publications in 2020 is approximately 16 times higher the number in 2011. This growth rate is not only the highest in Northern Africa but in the whole continent. Figure 3.9: TEST RE-related co-publications of the Northern African countries shows a rich international network but the co-publication network with other African regions stays relatively less dense. Only African countries from other regions which have co-published over 25 RE-related papers with Northern African countries are South Africa (28 pub.) and Nigeria (26 pub.). Egypt, the most visible country in Northern Africa, with ~6.6k publications in total plays a central role in the network, relatively uniform distributed co-publication network of Egypt includes over 10 EU-27 countries as well as a number of countries from other regions of the world like USA, China, India, United Kingdom. Egypt’s strongest link in the co-publications however is with organisations from Saudi Arabia. Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco have relatively high numbers of collaborations with French organisations with 751, 881 and 601 co-publications respectively. France in general is the most visible EU-27 country in the RE-related co-publications with African countries. The 4 mentioned Northern African countries so far, Egypt, Algeria, Tunisia and Morocco are co-publication wise relatively well interconnected, however, Libya stays out of the co-publication cluster in Northern Africa, from Libya’s 233 RE-related publications in the last 10 years none of the Northern African countries had over 25 co-publications with Libya, instead Libya’s most visible collaborators are United Kingdom (38 co-pub.) and Malaysia (29 co-pub.). Following the given analysis of RE-related publication outputs in the Northern Africa; Egypt, Algeria and Morocco have been chosen for the deeper analysis of the individual countries. While Egypt and Algeria hold the highest numbers of RE-related publications in the northern region, Morocco has been mainly chosen for the high growth rate in the number of publications. 3.2.1.1 Egypt The most visible Egyptian organisation in the RE-related publications is Cairo university with a total 779 publications between 2011-2020. All of the most visible 5 organisations show relatively linear growth in number of RE-related publications. However, Ain Shams University and Tanta University show a stagnation between 2019-2020 which might be caused by the delay of document entries into the Web of Science system as mentioned earlier. Furthermore, Tanta University, which had yearly fewer than 50 RE-related publications until 2016, published in 2019 and 2020 ~125 RE-related papers, this a growth rate of ~14 with respect to the 9 publications in 2011. Figure 3.10: TEST Co-publication network of Egyptian organisations display a relatively dense collaboration structure between Cairo University, Ain Shams University and National Research Centre of Egpyt with over 50 publications together. Individual collaborations of those organisations include collaborations with 7 other Egyptian academic organisations with over 20 RE-related co-publications. Another visible collaborations are between Minia and Aswan Universities with over 50 publications and between Tanta and Kafrelsheikh Universities with over 70 publications together. In general collaborations with organisations from Saudi Arabia are highly visible in the network, other than Tanta University’s collaborations with Chinese Institutions and Aswan University’s with Japanese orgnisations also present links with more than 20 publications together. Visible organisations from EU-27 countries are Université Bourgogne Franche-Comté from France, Ruhr university Bochum from Germany, Budapest University of Technology and Economics from Hungary and University of Jaen from Spain. 3.2.2 Western Africa, Central Africa, Eastern Africa Figure 3.11: RE-related publication output in Western African countries Western African countries Nigeria and Ghana have been increasing their RE-related publication output in a consistent manner in the 10 years range (see table 3.11) without any stagnation. Although Nigeria’s number of publications in 2011 already relatively high in comparison (74 pub.), number of publications in 2020 was ~6.5 folds (481 pub.) of that. Volatility in the publication nummbers of Senegal, Burkina Faso and Benin is expected since their publication outputs relatively lower. Figure 3.12: Co-publication network of Western African countries in RE-related publications between 2011-2020 Nigeria is also the centre of mass in the co-publication network of the Western African countries. It is the only Western African country with more than 25 co-publications with a Northern African country (Egypt, 26 co-pub). In a similar manner, together with Ghana Nigeria is the only Western African Country with more than 25 co-pub. with South Africa (277 pub.), namely the most visible country in Africa. Nigeria also collaborates with Ghana, the second most visible country from Western Africa. Collaborations of those 2 countries are mostly produced with international partners United Kingdom, China and United States. However, the collaborations between the two most visible countries in the region with the other countries are relatively sparse. Côte d’Ivoire, Benin, Senegal, Burkina Faso and Mali are mostly engaged in their own cluster. The most visible international partner of that cluster is France. French academic organisations have co-publicated ~400 papers with Western African countries between 2011-2020 and most of those have been carried out with the mentioned 5 countries. Other than France, Germany and Netherlands are also engaged in the RE-related publications in Western Africa; Sweden and Denmar are mostly collaborated with Ghana and Italian organisations have mostly co-published with Nigerian organisations. Other visible international partners in the region are Malaysia and India. Figure 3.13: Most visible organisations from Nigeria, Ghana, Senegal cluster Figure 3.14: RE-related publication output in Central African countries In the Central African region the publication output in the RE-related topics is relatively volatile. Cameroon shows a steady increment between 2011-2020 (see 3.14) with a total output of 379 RE-related publications in 10 years. Other than Cameroon Figure 3.15: Co-publication network of Central African countries in RE-related publications between 2011-2020 France is again the most visible EU-27 country in the co-publication network in Central Africa with 121 co-pub. with the most visible Central African country Cameroon. Although the publication output is not high in comparison with other regions, most of the publications in Central Africa produced through international co-operation and all of the visible international collaborator countries are engaged in co-publications with Cameroon, most visible country in the region. Figure 3.16: Most visible organisations from Cameroon, Dem. Rep. Congo, Gabon cluster Figure 3.17: RE-related publication output in Eastern African countries The most visible 5 Eastern African countries have steadily increasing number of RE-related publications (see 3.17). Ethiopia and Kenya are the most visible ones with 940 and 870 publications respectively. Ethiopia’s number of publications in 2020 (226 pub.) is approximetaly 8 fold of the number in 2011 (28). Figure 3.18: Co-publication network of Eastern African countries in RE-related publications between 2011-2020 4 most visible countries in Eastern Africa; Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda are fairly interconnected in terms of RE-related co-publications with each other as well as with international collaborators. A number of EU-27 countries like France, Italy, Germany, Belgium, Sweden, Netherlands, Austria, Spain and Denmark are engaged in co-publications with Eastern African countries. Both Ethiopia and Kenya show significant number of co-publications with Germany (72 and 134 pub. respectively). France is also the only collaborator of Madagascar with a number of pub. higher than 25 between 2011-2020. Other than EU countries United States and United Kingdom are also visible international partners engaged in RE-related research with Eastern African organisations. United States has ~500 co-publications with the region. South Africa is the only African country from another region that has more than 25 RE-related co-publications with the Eastern African countries.
