You can use anything that Pandoc’s Markdown supports, e.g., a math equation \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\). The bookdown package can be installed from CRAN or Github: install.packages(&quot;bookdown&quot;) # or the development version # devtools::install_github(&quot;rstudio/bookdown&quot;) Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading #. To compile this example to PDF, you need XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): https://yihui.org/tinytex/.

If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter ??. Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 1.1: Here is a nice figure! Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 1.1. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 1.1. knitr::kable( head(iris, 20), caption = &#39;Here is a nice table!&#39;, booktabs = TRUE ) Table 1.1: Here is a nice table!

A co-publication is a publication that have been produced with collaboration of at least two organisations. Therefore, a co-publication contains at least two affiliations. 3.1 Overall Figures This sub-chapter mainly deals with number of RE-related publication outputs in African countries in the 10 years period between 2011-2020. Figure 3.1: Number of RE-related publications in African countries over the years between 2011-2020 African countries have collaborated in approximately 31k renewable energy (RE) publications in the 10 year range between 2011-2020. The number of those RE-related publications has been constantly increasing between until 2019. Slightly declining publication numbers between 2019 and 2020 (see 3.1), as Web of Science team also often emphasises, is caused by the latency in the database entries.1 Even after including the possibly incomplete amount of publications in 2020, number of RE-related publications from the African countries in total increases from ~1.1k in 2011 to ~4.8k in 2020 which is an increment by factor ~4.2. Figure 3.2: Total number of RE-related publications in African countries between 2011-2020 As 3.2 shows, South Africa and Egypt are the most visible countries with 6.8k and 6.6k publications respectively. 20 countries stay under 40 RE-related publications in total between 2011-2020, the most visible countries distributed diversely on the continent. Although total publication output is a strong indicator of the most visible countries, it does not show the growth rate in the number of Publications. African countries that show high increment rate in the number of publications despite having relatively lower total amount of publications will be analysed in the following chapter. Figure 3.3: Most visible 15 African countries in RE-related publications between 2011-2020 Figure 3.4: Most visible 15 research areas in RE-related publications between 2011-2020 3.2 Regional Analysis Following the overall figures of the RE-related publications in Africa this sub-chapter introduces geographical regions of Africa to bring the analysis one step further. Focusing on different regions of Africa prevents the over representation of already more visible countries in terms of publications in general and also enables a Figure 3.5: test Although the most common definition of African geographical regions is the categorization of the United Nations Statistics Department (UNSD), as the Figure 3.5 shows, this research uses a different categorization, namely African Union Geographical Regions. The reason for this decision solely lies on the more evenly sized regions in AU categorization. 3.2.1 Northern Africa Figure 3.6: RE-related publication output in Northern African countries Countries of Northern Africa have collaborated approximately in the half of the total number of renewable energy related publications (17116 publications out of 31099). 4 of the 5 most visible African countries in RE-related publications are from the northern region; namely Egypt, Algeria, Tunisia and Morocco. As table 3.6 presents all of the Northern Africa countries increased their number of RE-related publications. Although, as discussed in the previous chapter, slight declines in the number of publications between 2019-2020 are most likely caused by the delay of document entry into the Web of Science databases, Algeria and Tunisia show a decline in their number of publications starting 2017 and 2018 respectively. In the cases of Libya and Mauritania, however, volatility in the number of publications is expected as their total publication outputs are relatively lower. Another important observation is in the relative growth rates,2 Morocco’s number of RE-related publications in 2020 is approximately 16 times higher the number in 2011. This growth rate is not only the highest in Northern Africa but in the whole continent. Following the given analysis of RE-related publication outputs in the Northern Africa; Egypt, Algeria and Morocco have been chosen for the deeper analysis of the individual countries. While Egypt and Algeria hold the highest numbers of RE-related publications in the northern region, Morocco has been mainly chosen for the high growth rate in the number of publications.
