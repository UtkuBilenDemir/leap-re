# Abstract {-}

The present report displays the results of the scientometric study on the renewable energy 
research-capacity in African countries by focusing on the publications in the 10 years range between 2011-2020. In order to deliver a comprehensive overview, after the analysis of the African countries in their respective African Union regions and international co-publication networks, the study has been broadened into organisational co-publication networks of the selected countries as well as the analysis of the most visible research areas and keywords/ keyword pairs from the selected organisations. Moreover, as a further point of view, renewable energy related publications from the African countries are also categorised under distinct research domains to show the most visible organisational pairings as well as most visible and trending keywords/ keyword pairs in different clusters of scientific areas.

# Introduction {#intro}

This study mainly focuses on renewable energy (RE) related research in African countries between 2011-2020. The study has been carried out under the project [LEAP-RE](https://www.leap-re.eu/) (Long-Term Joint European Union - African Union Research and Innovation Partnership on Renewable Energy) *Task 5.3: Strategy for RE research-capacity in Africa* with the co-lead of [MESRS (Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research)](https://www.mesrs.dz/) and [ZSI (Centre for Social Innovation)](https://www.zsi.at/). 

The results, which will be displayed in the following chapters, are generated through a cleaned, normalised and recategorised dataset created with the data collected from the [Clarivate's Web of Science](https://www.webofscience.com) databases. A comprehensive discussion about the methods can be found in Chapter \@ref(method).

Following the explanation of the methodology in the next chapter, Chapter \@ref(results) displays the results of the study. After showing the overall figures in Section \@ref(overall-figures) which include a general overview of the yearly RE-related publication output in the African continent, the most visible countries and organisations as well as the distribution of research domains and areas, Section \@ref(regional-analysis) focuses on individual African Union Geographic Regions[^0101]. The regional analysis generally deals with the most visible countries in each region as well as their co-publication networks which also include interregional (partnerships with other African countries from other regions) and intercontinental (partnerships with countries from other continents) collaborations. Furthermore, the analysis also focuses on selected countries in each region to display the most visible organisations and organisational co-publication networks as well. The regional analysis also includes at least 1 selected organisation from each selected country to present the most visible research areas and keyword/keyword pair networks on the organisational level. Finally, Section \@ref(domain-analysis) approaches the RE research in Africa from another direction and by splitting publications into research domains in order to discuss the most visible co-publication pairings between organisations as well as most visible keywords/ keyword pairs in each distinct cluster of scientific areas.

The report will be delivered in 3 different formats. An HTML-File which includes the whole scope of the report with interactive visualisations, a PDF-File which is content-wise identical to the HTML-File with static visualisations instead of interactive. And a dashboard where the results will be displayed in a compact mode interactively. 







[^0101]: The 5 African Union Geographic Regions; Northern Africa, Western Africa, Central Africa, Eastern Africa, and Southern Africa have been defined by the Organisation of African Unity in 1976 (CM/Res.464QCXVI). A list of countries in each region can
be found under [https://au.int/en/member_states/countryprofiles2](https://au.int/en/member_states/countryprofiles2).

# Methodology {#method}

This chapter mainly deals with the explanation of the methodological definitions, information about the data collection, preprocessing, analysis, and visualisation/ report writing phases.

## Definitions
**Research Area/ Research Domain.** Research areas are the scientific fields defined by the Web of Science (WoS). Research domains are the 5 parent categories (Physical Sciences, Technology, Life Sciences & Biomedicine, Social Sciences, Arts & Humanities) of the research areas [^0201].  

**Co-publication**. A publication that has been produced with the collaboration of at least 2 authors from 2 different organisations.

**Interregional co-publication**. Interregionality in this Report refers to different African countries from different African Union (AU) regions. An interregional co-publication, therefore, is a paper published with the collaboration of at least 2 authors from African organisations from different regions of Africa.

**Intercontinental co-publication**. Co-publications of at least 2 organisations located on different continents.

**Relative growth rate**. A simple indicator of how many folds the number of publications has been increased in comparison with the number of publications in the start year (2011). The equation is simply:

\[
rel\_growth\_rate := end\_value/start\_value
\]

## Data Source & Methodological Steps

The study is based on the data from Clarivate's Web of Science (WoS) databases. After the unification of the collected RE-related keywords, different types of search queries have been tested on WoS. A search query with over 80% accuracy for the identification of RE-related research has been determined through sampling processes.

The data collected from WoS databases through the decided search query have been turned into a common dataset for the use of all partners collaborating in the study. The generated dataset has been transformed by preprocessing steps like data cleaning, normalisation, reduction, and categorisation. The normalisation of the organisation names is done with the help of the [Global Research Identifier Database (GRID)](https://www.grid.ac/).

Following the preprocessing steps, an exploratory data analysis has been carried out and some of the key figures have been visualised to decide for focus points of the study between the partners.

Further data analysis has been carried out accordingly to the joint decision on the report format/ outline planning and visualisations have been designed to work interactively.

# Results {#results}

Following clarification of  the motivation and methodology of the 
scientometric analysis on the renewable energy (RE) related research in Africa, 
this chapter is dedicated to the presentation of the results under the following
3 sub-chapters:

1. Overall Figures
2. Regional Analysis
3. Domain Analysis

After delivering a general overview on yearly output, the most visible
countries and organisations as well as distribution of scientific domains and
areas in the RE-related publications in African countries between 2011-2020, *Regional
Analysis* focuses on each of the 5 regions (Northern Africa, Western Africa, Central Africa,
Eastern Africa, Southern Africa)[^0301] individually. Analysis of the geographic regions
include:

* Most visible countries.
* Regional, interregional, and intercontinental collaboration networks of all countries in the region.
* Collaboration networks of the academic organisations in *selected countries*[^0302]. 
* Analysis of the most visible research areas and the correlation network of the
keyword/keyword pairs in the RE-related publications of the *selected organisations*[^0303].

*Domain Analysis* approaches RE-related research in Africa from a different perspective
by analysing the publications under the 5 research domains Physical Sciences,
Technology, Life Sciences & Biomedicine, Social Sciences and Arts & Humanities[^0304]. Analysis
of each domain includes:

* Most visible inter-regional/ intercontinental collaborations between academic organisations.
* Most visible and trending keywords/ keyword pairs.

[^0301]: A list of the countries in each African Union region can
be found under [https://au.int/en/member_states/countryprofiles2](https://au.int/en/member_states/countryprofiles2).

[^0302]: The two deciding factors for the selection were, firstly, the total RE-related 
publication output, and secondly, the relative growth in the number of RE-related publications.

[^0303]: Selection criteria were the same as the criteria for countries.

[^0304]: Web of Science's research area/domain classification can be found under [https://images.webofknowledge.com/images/help/WOS/hp_research_areas_easca.html](https://images.webofknowledge.com/images/help/WOS/hp_research_areas_easca.html). Because of the fewer number of publications, Social Sciences and Arts & Humanities have been analysed together.

# Conclusion

The present study aimed to achieve a comprehensive analysis of the renewable energy research capacity in Africa. Although renewable energy research is a fairly broad topic and solely relying on scientometric research cannot cover all of its aspects, the study results yielded some important observations about the general situation of RE research capacity in African countries.

The number of RE-related publications is increasing in every region of Africa. Although Northern and Southern Africa publishing the biggest part of the total of RE-related publications in Africa, lots of countries from Western, Central and Eastern Africa are increasing their output rapidly.

African regions seem to be fairly well interconnected in their individual regions and several of them show a considerable amount of co-publications with intercontinental partners. However, in general, there is a lack of interregional collaboration in the African continent. Only some of the most visible countries appear in other regions as one of the most visible collaborators. In relation, a number of African countries also tend to collaborate with a specific cluster of intercontinental partners with very little diversity.

The content of the RE-related publications in Africa displays a strong emphasis especially on solar energy related science and technology in recent years followed by wind energy and biomass related topics. Furthermore, African academic organisations also increasingly research geographical specifications of their regions that could be beneficial for a specific kind of RE approach.

The analysis of the trending research areas in the most visible organisations also displayed that in the last couple of years there is a sudden decline in the most visible research areas in terms of yearly publications (e.g. Energy & Fuels). Simultaneously, there are a few previously less visible research areas that are rapidly growing in numbers. Questions like if there is a real shift in RE-related research away from previously dominant areas or if specific topics are categorised under other disciplines than before, furthermore, if this transition indicates that the same cluster of academicians is now working in other disciplines or if the academicians working in previously dominant research areas abandoning RE-related research and vice versa are questions to be answered with further research.
